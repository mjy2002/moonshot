# Moonshot

The Moonshot is a ```M``` designed 151mm motor to motor 3" freestyle and racing frame in teh sub-250 gram category.

> Originally a curiusity, the design soon solidifed into one of the best flying quads we have ever used. Fast, agile, durable, and mechanically uncompromised, the Moonshot is that sexy sub-250 gram frame you can't put down.

Specification:

* 151mm mtm "mild stretch" frame
* Nominal 1.05:1 ratio (L:W)
* 200-350g AUW
* 13xx and 14xx motors
* 3" props
* 30.5mm and 20mm flight controller ready
* Top mount battery, but underslung is also supported.
* 15-30mm standoff depending on component as and stack
* Supports bracket mount of RunCam Swift Mini(tight), also supports most HS1177 cameras with 3D printed bucket.
* 3-4s battery 450-950mah. XT30 connection recommended, but JST works great is installed properly.
* Small rx recommended like XM+

### Target Pilot

Advanced beginner and up!  Incorporation of 30.5mm PCB support allows a build to take advantage of the greater market in FC, PDB, and VTX making builds simple and maintainable.  The build is tight, as one woudl expect, but there is enough room for common components and a maintainable layout.

### Building the Moonshot

* The frame design requires a good control of wires, length, and direct connection (solder not bullets.
* ESCs can be mounted on the arm or via AIO PCBs
The flight controller is mounted via bolt or standoff, builders choice.
*The top plate attaches via standoff (20 to 30mm is common) and is provided to yield tight support for flight cameras.
* The VTX should be mounted under the top plate in the rear, check your dimensions. Generally an uncased FX79* form factor works but the VTX and standoff outside dimension is very important!
* The ideal camera is a RunCam Stift Mini mounting via the bracket. However HS1177 and others are supported and will require per build considerations.
